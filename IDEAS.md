* Dominance relation: if you have a word that has some red letters, and you can change those letters to unknown/yellow/green letters to make another word, always guess that word instead.

    * Generalization: never guess a word whose partitioning of the remaining possibilities is strictly coarser than some other word's partitioning. (where the remaining possibilities P are partitioned based on the hint that the guess would return if P was the target) (a partition A is "strictly coarser" than another one B if you can get A by condensing subsets of B)


* If you're 5 letters in, then there's nothing you can guess that guarantees victory.
